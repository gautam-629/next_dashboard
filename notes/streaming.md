# Next.js Streaming Guide

## What is Streaming?

Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smaller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready. This approach prevents slow data requests from blocking the entire page load.

## Benefits

- Allows users to see and interact with parts of the page without waiting for all data to load
- Reduces overall page loading time by rendering chunks in parallel
- Enables interruptible navigation - users can navigate away before full page load
- Works naturally with React's component model, as each component can be a chunk

## Implementation Methods in Next.js

### 1. Page-Level Streaming

Using `loading.tsx`:

- Create a `loading.tsx` file in your route directory
- Provides a fallback UI while page content loads
- Static content renders immediately while dynamic content streams

Example:

```tsx
// app/dashboard/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />;
}
```

### 2. Component-Level Streaming

Using `Suspense`:

- Wrap dynamic components in Suspense
- Provide fallback UI for loading states
- Enables granular control over streaming boundaries

Example:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from "react";

<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSkeleton />}>
  <DynamicComponent />
</Suspense>;
```

## Loading Skeletons

- Simplified versions of the UI shown during loading
- Embedded as part of the static file and sent first
- Provides better user experience than simple loading text
- Should match the layout of the actual content

## Route Groups

- Created using parentheses in folder names: `(groupname)`
- Don't affect URL path structure
- Useful for organizing files and controlling loading UI scope
- Can separate application into logical sections

## Best Practices

### Data Fetching

- Move data fetches to components that need the data
- Wrap data-dependent components in Suspense
- Consider grouping related components to prevent jarring UI updates

### Suspense Boundary Placement

Consider:

- Desired user experience during streaming
- Content prioritization
- Data dependencies between components
- Visual consistency during loading

### Common Patterns

1. Whole Page Streaming
   - Simple but may lead to longer perceived loading times
2. Individual Component Streaming
   - More granular control but may cause UI popping
3. Sectioned Streaming
   - Groups related components
   - Creates staggered loading effect
   - Requires wrapper components

## Implementation Tips

- Use route groups to control loading.tsx scope
- Group related components to prevent visual jarring
- Implement appropriate loading skeletons that match content layout
- Consider component dependencies when placing Suspense boundaries
- Don't be afraid to experiment with different streaming strategies

Remember: There's no one-size-fits-all approach. The best streaming strategy depends on your application's specific needs and user experience requirements.
